# Predicting the Poverty Ratio in Indonesia: Time Series Predictive Approach
The code is designed to predict the poverty rate in Indonesia using historical data from 1998 to 2023. It employs various forecasting methods, including Na√Øve Model, Double Moving Average, Double Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Time Series Regression, and Neural Network, resulting in a total of 26 models. Out of these, 19 models were evaluated based on metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and MDAE. The analysis concluded that the NNETAR Neural Network model achieved the best performance in predicting the poverty ratio, providing valuable insights into effective poverty prediction methodologies.

## Additional Information
The code was developed as a final project for a university course on Time Series Analysis. This academic endeavor provided an opportunity to apply theoretical concepts and practical techniques in forecasting to real-world data, specifically focusing on the challenges of predicting poverty rates. By exploring various forecasting models, the project aimed to deepen the understanding of time series methodologies while contributing to the broader discourse on poverty alleviation in Indonesia.
